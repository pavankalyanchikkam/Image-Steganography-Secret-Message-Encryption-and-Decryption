## Overview 🚀

- **Purpose**:  
  Develop a robust and user-friendly tool for embedding and extracting secret messages within images using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. This project was created during the AICTE-IBM internship to showcase practical steganography techniques.

- **Key Features**:  
  - 🔒 **Secure Messaging**: Hides sensitive data within lossless PNG images to maintain data integrity.  
  - ⚙️ **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of encryption, decryption, and GUI components for easy maintenance and scalability.  
  - 🖥️ **Intuitive GUI**: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter simplifies the process of encrypting and decrypting messages.  
  - 🔄 **Extensibility**: Structured design that facilitates future enhancements, such as advanced cryptographic methods and support for additional media formats.
